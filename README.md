# Jira-scrapper
The goal of this script is to export a backlog from Jira. 

# Motivation
I was working for a client using an on-premise version of Jira that did not allow exportations, therefore when giving Powerpoint presentations to the management people would manually copy the backlog wasting a lot of time. 

I wrote this really simple script and taught everyone how to use it as soon as I heard of this painful and mistake inducing manual operation.
